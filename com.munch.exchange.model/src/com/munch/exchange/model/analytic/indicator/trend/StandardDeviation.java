/**
 * 
 * Standard Deviation
 * 
 * Standard Deviation — value of the market volatility measurement. This
 * indicator describes the range of price fluctuations relative to Moving
 * Average. So, if the value of this indicator is high, the market is volatile,
 * and prices of bars are rather spread relative to the moving average. If the
 * indicator value is low, the market can described as having a low volatility,
 * and prices of bars are rather close to the moving average.
 * 
 * Normally, this indicator is used as a constituent of other indicators. Thus,
 * when calculating Bollinger Bands® one has to add the symbol standard
 * deviation value to its moving average.
 * 
 * The market behavior represents the interchange of high trading activity and
 * languid market. So, the indicator can be interpreted easily:
 * 
 * •if its value is too low, i.e., the market is absolutely inactive, it makes
 * sense to expect a spike soon;
 * 
 * •otherwise, if it is extremely high, it most probably means that activity
 * will decline soon.
 * 
 * Standard Deviation Calculation
 * 
 * StdDev (i) = SQRT (AMOUNT (j = i - N, i) / N)
 * 
 * AMOUNT (j = i - N, i) = SUM ((ApPRICE (j) - MA (ApPRICE , N, i)) ^ 2)
 * 
 * Where:
 * 
 * StdDev (i) — Standard Deviation of the current bar; SQRT — square root;
 * AMOUNT(j = i - N, i) — sum of squares from j = i - N to i; N — smoothing
 * period; ApPRICE (j) — applied price of the j bar; MA (ApPRICE , N, i) —
 * moving average value with the N period on the current bar; ApPRICE (i) —
 * applied price of the current bar.
