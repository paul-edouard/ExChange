/**
 * Bollinger Bands Technical Indicator (BB) is similar to Envelopes. The only
 * difference is that the bands of Envelopes are plotted a fixed distance (%)
 * away from the moving average, while the Bollinger Bands are plotted a certain
 * number of standard deviations away from it. Standard deviation is a measure
 * of volatility, therefore Bollinger Bands adjust themselves to the market
 * conditions. When the markets become more volatile, the bands widen and they
 * contract during less volatile periods.
 * 
 * Bollinger Bands are usually plotted on the price chart, but they can be also
 * added to the indicator chart. Just like in case of the Envelopes, the
 * interpretation of the Bollinger Bands is based on the fact that the prices
 * tend to remain in between the top and the bottom line of the bands. A
 * distinctive feature of the Bollinger Band indicator is its variable width due
 * to the volatility of prices. In periods of considerable price changes (i.e.
 * of high volatility) the bands widen leaving a lot of room to the prices to
 * move in. During standstill periods, or the periods of low volatility the band
 * contracts keeping the prices within their limits..
 * 
 * The following traits are particular to the Bollinger Band:
 * 
 * 1.abrupt changes in prices tend to happen after the band has contracted due
 * to decrease of volatility;
 * 
 * 2.if prices break through the upper band, a continuation of the current trend
 * is to be expected;
 * 
 * 3.if the pikes and hollows outside the band are followed by pikes and hollows
 * inside the band, a reverse of trend may occur;
 * 
 * 4.the price movement that has started from one of the band’s lines usually
 * reaches the opposite one.
 * 
 * The last observation is useful for forecasting price guideposts.
 * 
 * Bollinger Bands Calculation
 * 
 * Bollinger bands are formed by three lines. The middle line (ML) is a usual
 * Moving Average.
 * 
 * ML = SUM (CLOSE, N) / N = SMA (CLOSE, N)
 * 
 * The top line (TL) is the same as the middle line a certain number of standard
 * deviations (D).
 * 
 * TL = ML + (D * StdDev)
 * 
 * The bottom line (BL) is the middle line shifted down by the same number of
 * standard deviations.
 * 
 * BL = ML - (D * StdDev)
 * 
 * Where:
 * 
 * SUM (..., N) — sum for N periods; CLOSE — close price; N — number of periods
 * used in calculation; SMA — Simple Moving Average; SQRT — square root; StdDev
 * — standard deviation:
 * 
 * StdDev = SQRT (SUM ((CLOSE — SMA (CLOSE, N))^2, N)/N)
 * 
 * It is recommended to use 20-period Simple Moving Average as the middle line,
 * and plot top and bottom lines two standard deviations away from it. Besides,
 * moving averages of less than 10 periods are of little effect.
